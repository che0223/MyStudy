In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level(base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n\nㅑ ㅡㅛㄴ디갸ㅐㅓ대러댜재러ㅐㅑㅈ대ㅑ렂댜ㅐㅓ래ㅑㄷ쟈ㅐ러ㅑㅐㄷㅈㄹ","metadata":{}}]}
